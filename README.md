# Ethnic-Identity-Development-Research-Project
The goal of this study is to extend research of ethnic identity development by examining how three components of ethnic identity: ethnic search, achievement and commitment; change across the transition from high school to college. (Undergraduate research project completed at the University at Buffalo)

### Research Question:
How does ethnic identity develop across the transition from high school to college?

### Hypothesis:
There will be an increase across all three components of ethnic identity: ethnic search, achievement, and commitment.


### Method:

Participants:

We recruited the entire 12th grade from three public high schools in the Buffalo area.

Materials:

The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) revised (Phinney, 1992) was used in this study 
* Items are rated on a four-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree through 4= strongly agree).
* The measure contained 13 items: 
  * 5 ethnic identity search
  * 7 achievement and/or commitment
  * 3 questions on self identification of ethnicity, father’s and mother’s ethnicity.


### Conclusion:

We were expecting to see an increase across all three components of ethnic identity across the transition from high school to college 

* Our findings supported the hypothesis for the commitment and achievement components 
  * Participants were more likely to commit to their ethnic identity while in college
  * Participants reported significantly higher levels of ethnic identity achievement in college 
* Whereas there was a normative decrease in ethnic search over time. 
This finding does not support our initial hypothesis.
